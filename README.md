NumPy Array Operations
Welcome to the NumPy Array Operations repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and mastering array operations using the NumPy library in Python.

Overview
NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for multidimensional arrays and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

Contents
1. Introduction to NumPy Arrays
Overview of NumPy library: array data structure, advantages, and applications.
Installation instructions and getting started with NumPy.
2. Array Creation and Manipulation
Creating NumPy arrays: np.array(), np.zeros(), np.ones(), np.arange(), np.linspace(), etc.
Indexing and slicing arrays: accessing elements, subarrays, and array views.
Reshaping arrays: changing the shape and dimensions of arrays.
3. Array Operations
Arithmetic operations: element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Universal functions (ufuncs): mathematical functions applied element-wise to arrays.
Broadcasting: implicit element-wise operations between arrays of different shapes.
4. Aggregation and Statistical Operations
Aggregating functions: np.sum(), np.mean(), np.median(), np.std(), np.min(), np.max(), etc.
Computing statistics across arrays or along specified axes.
Random number generation: creating arrays with random values using np.random.
5. Linear Algebra Operations
Matrix operations: dot product, matrix multiplication, inverse, and determinant.
Solving linear systems of equations.
Eigenvalue and eigenvector computations.
6. Case Studies
Practical examples and case studies demonstrating the application of NumPy for real-world array operations tasks.
Datasets and analysis techniques to reinforce learning.
Requirements
Python (3.x recommended)
NumPy library
